        <h2>The Original Story</h2>
          <div class="text-one">
            <p>On July 3, 1947, near Roswell, New Mexico, there was a crash in the desert
              discovered by rancher Mac Brazel. Upon finding strange debris, Brazel would
              later report the crash to local Sheriff Wilcox who informed the Roswell Army
              Air Field (RAAF). After the RAAF was contacted, the wreckage was collected
              and a press release was issued titled “RAAF Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch
              in Roswell Region.” Immediately after the military announced that the “saucer”
              was just a weather balloon and issued a new story titled “Army Debunks Roswell
              Flying Disk as World Simmers with Excitement” with photographs of the debris,
              clearing up the confusion and silencing the story.</p>

        <h2>Return to Popularity and Controversies</h2>
          <div class="text-two">
            <p>The Roswell incident did not see popularity again until 1980 when The Roswell
              Incident was published, creating controversy, new conspiracies, and hoaxes that
              sparked an interest. While there are a few theories the overlaying idea in all
              of them is that the Roswell incident was one massive cover story created by the
              United States Government. That day in Roswell a flying saucer did crash and was
              taken from the site, being replaced with material from a weather balloon.
              The military then fixed the hasty press release with a new story debunking the
              previous statement, hiding the secret away from the public. Some of the most
              prominent evidence comes from major Jesse Marcel, Jesse Marcel Jr, and many
              eyewitness accounts. Major Marcel would admit to a cover-up, giving out details
              that he was forced to hold pieces of a weather balloon at a press conference to
              debunk the UFO crash story released previously. He described the material
              as “a kind of metal which would spring back into shape after being crumpled” and took
              it home to show his son. Many use descriptions given by major Marcel to debunk
              the reportings of the materials at the crash site, which were said to be tinfoil,
              rubber strips, and sticks. How could a major of the US airforce mistake tinfoil,
              rubber strips, and sticks for something he described as “not of this Earth”. At the site major
              Marcel struggled to identify the debris, looking through pieces and trying to make sense of it.
              Jesse Marcel Jr has told accounts of his father coming home that day in 1947, bringing home some
              debris in the night and waking Marcel Jr, telling him to look at it as it was something he would
              never see again. As for eyewitness accounts, many of them told about seeing unusual debris and
              alien bodies being taken away.</p>

        <h2>Response to Controversies</h2>
          <div class="text-three">
            <p>With such controversy and theories popping up about the Roswell incident, the US Government has
              been forced to lay out much evidence for what happened that day of the crash. Shortly following
              the first press release, photographs of Major Marcel posing with pieces of the now recognized weather
              balloon were put in the following story. In 1994 it was revealed that the balloon was part of a
              top-secret project to detect Soviet nuclear bomb tests, Project Mogul. This project
              would explain the newspaper cover-up and rush to retrieve debris as the US military did not secrets
              leaked about their spy work during the Cold War. In 1997 an air force report, “The Roswell Report:
              Case Closed”, covered those civilians who claimed to witness alien bodies. The alien
              bodies may have come from parachute crash test dummies, a severely injured airman parachutist, and
              charred bodies from an airplane crash during the 1950s. The report proposed that the
              witnesses consolidated the separate events in their memories. These experiments, meant
              to test ways for pilots to survive falls from high altitudes, sent bandaged, featureless
              dummies with latex “skin” and aluminum “bones” falling from the sky onto the ground, whereupon
              military vehicles would descend on the landing site to retrieve the “bodies” as quickly as
              possible.</p>
