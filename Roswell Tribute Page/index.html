          <h2>The Original Story</h2>
            <div class="text-one">
              <p>On July 3, 1947, near Roswell, New Mexico, there was a crash in the desert
                discovered by rancher Mac Brazel. Upon finding strange debris, Brazel would
                later report the crash to local Sheriff Wilcox who informed the Roswell Army
                Air Field (RAAF).</p>
                <p> After the RAAF was contacted, the wreckage was collected
                and a press release was issued titled “RAAF Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch
                in Roswell Region.”</p>
                <p>Immediately after the military announced that the “saucer”
                was just a weather balloon and issued a new story titled “Army Debunks Roswell
                Flying Disk as World Simmers with Excitement” with photographs of the debris,
                clearing up the confusion and silencing the story.</p>
            </div>

        <div id="second">
          <img src="images/crash-site.jpg" alt="Original crashsite sign">
          <h2>Return to Popularity</h2>
            <div class="text-two">
              <p>The Roswell incident did not see popularity again until 1980 when The Roswell
                Incident was published, creating controversy, new conspiracies, and hoaxes that
                sparked an interest. The conspiracy many believe is that day in Roswell a flying saucer did crash and was
                taken from the site, being replaced with material from a weather balloon.</p>
                <p>The military then fixed the hasty press release with a new story debunking the
                previous statement, hiding the secret away from the public. Some of the most
                prominent evidence comes from major Jesse Marcel, Jesse Marcel Jr, and many
                eyewitness accounts.</p>
                <p>Major Marcel would admit to a cover-up, giving out details
                that he was forced to hold pieces of a weather balloon at a press conference to
                debunk the UFO crash story released previously.</p>

          <h2>Response to Controversies</h2>
            <div class="text-three">
              <p>With such controversy and theories popping up about the Roswell incident, the US Government has
                been forced to lay out much evidence for what happened that day of the crash. In 1994 it was revealed that the balloon was part of a
                top-secret project to detect Soviet nuclear bomb tests, Project Mogul.</p>
                <p>In 1997 an air force report, “The Roswell Report: Case Closed”, covered those civilians who claimed to witness alien bodies. The alien
                bodies may have come from parachute crash test dummies, a severely injured airman parachutist, and
                charred bodies from an airplane crash during the 1950s.</p>
                <p>These experiments, meant to test ways for pilots to survive falls from high altitudes, sent bandaged, featureless
                dummies with latex “skin” and aluminum “bones” falling from the sky onto the ground, whereupon
                military vehicles would descend on the landing site to retrieve the “bodies” as quickly as
                possible.</p>
